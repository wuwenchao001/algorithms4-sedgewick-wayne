the integers 0, 1, ..., N-1 in that order (push directives) are intermixed with N minus signs (pop directives)

// Proof:
// Stack members from fist head to tail, become smaller.
// Thus, the permutation integers either bigger than anyone before
// (new Stack.push(newMaxInt) and then Stack.pop(newMaxInt))
// or become smaller eventually.

// Case Verification:
// If and only if it has no forbidden triple, it can be generated.
// reduction to absurdity > When not generated, it has forbidden triple.
// see Exercise 45

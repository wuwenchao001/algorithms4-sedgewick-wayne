This is a very efficient operation,
doesn't involve copying the arrays,
doesn't affected by the size of the arrays,

To swap the references.
it simply changes the references,
which is a constant time operation, i.e., O(1).

int[] t = a; // t now references the same array as a
a = b;       // a now references the same array as b
b = t;       // b now references the same array as t, which is the original array a

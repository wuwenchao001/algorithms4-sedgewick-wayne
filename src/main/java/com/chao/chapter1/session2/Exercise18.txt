Welford's algorithm:


The mean method simply returns the current mean m.

The var method returns the variance,
which is the sum of the squares of differences from the mean (s), divided by (N - 1).
The -1 is because we're calculating the sample variance, not the population variance.

The stddev method returns the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance.

This implementation is correct and will correctly compute the mean, variance,
and standard deviation of the numbers presented as arguments to addDataValue.
